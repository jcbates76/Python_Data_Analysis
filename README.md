# Python_Data_Analysis
This repository contains two projects related to Python programming

## PyBank
This program analyzes the profit and losses over a number of consecutive periods.  
The dataset contains the following data in a CSV file:  
* Period (noted in Month-Year)  
* Profit/Losses for that period  
     
The following analysis is performed:  
* Report the total number of periods in the dataset.  
* Calculate the total Profit/Losses of the entirety of the dataset.  
* Calculate the changes of Profit/Losses over the entire period, then computes the average of the those changes.  
* Identify the period with the greatest increase in profits from the previous period.  
* Identify the period with the greatest decrease in profits from the previous period.  

The output is displayed in the terminal as well as provided in a TXT file.
